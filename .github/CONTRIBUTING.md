# Contributing

To add a package to the registry, simply fork the repository, edit
[manifest.json](../manifest.json) as needed, and send a pull request. Make sure
that the package you're adding has a `package.json` file.

As with contributions to the Alkahest core, packages that are borderline cheaty
will not be accepted. If your package seems sketchy, you will need to make a
strong case for its inclusion into the package registry.

Please note that the core developers may sometimes remove a package from the
registry if it has been broken for a long time with no fix in sight.
